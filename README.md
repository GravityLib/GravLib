Welcome Adventurer! This repository is a merged effort between programmers of active V5RC teams **1831E and 1831A** in the "Push Back" 2025-26 season. 

With this project, we are aiming to extend upon the existing LemLib project by @SizzinSeal and its contributors, optimising it for the "Push Back" season. 

If you decide to use our code, please consider **starring our project** (and lemlib) to support us!
